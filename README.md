## Running the Streamlit App

To explore the Gaussian Process functionality interactively, you can use the Streamlit app included in this repository. Follow these steps to run the app:

1. **Install the requirements**: Make sure you have all the necessary packages installed. You can do this by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Launch the Streamlit app**: Use the following command to start the app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the app**: Once the app is running, you can interact with it through your web browser. Adjust the noise level and kernel type to see how they affect the Gaussian Process.
