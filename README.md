This repository hosts my research proposal as a Streamlit application.
You can run it locally or deploy it to Vercel for easy access.

## Running the Streamlit App Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ozmendelsohn/interactive-research-proposal.git
   cd interactive-research-proposal
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Ensure you have a Vercel account and the Vercel CLI installed.

2. Deploy the app:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment process.

For more details on deploying with Vercel, refer to the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).
